# VHDL-projects
A collection of VHDL projects demonstrating expertise in FPGA and digital design. Includes a Single-Cycle MIPS Processor with Harvard architecture and memory-mapped I/O and hardware accelerators. These projects are developed as part of my computer engineering studies and self-learning.
